Learning how to do stuff

My name is SÃ¸ren
I hope to learn some programming as it has come to mind it is a powerful tool which I can use on a hobby scale as well as in my professional life, working with plant ecophysiology.
I think it helps when being part of a community or at least a place where people with more skill and experience are. Finally maybe also a place where I can find some inspiration for own projects.
